- 👋 Hi, I’m Batman.
- 🦇 I protect Gotham (and write code in my spare time).
- 🖥️ By day, I’m a developer. By night, I’m... still a developer, just in a darker theme.
- 🌱 Currently learning Android development and how to defeat bugs (villains).
- 💬 Talk to me about tech innovation, app development, or farming... Gotham needs crops too.
- 📫 Signal me with the Bat-Signal, or just send an email.
- 🦸‍♂️ Fun fact: I run a news channel, but I fight villains on the side.

  *I am vengeance. I am Batman.*
